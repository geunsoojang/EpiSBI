# EpiSBI

**EpiSBI** is an R toolbox designed to streamline Bayesian parameter estimation and forecasting in ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, particularly for infectious disease applications. This toolbox simplifies the complex process of Bayesian inference by automating the generation of Stan files, enabling users to configure models, define priors, and analyze results efficiently, even with minimal programming expertise.


## Features


## Usage

### 1. Configuring Your Model

Start by defining your ODE model, parameters, and priors in the `options_generaluse.R` file. This file allows you to specify the model variables, parameters, error structures, and priors.
